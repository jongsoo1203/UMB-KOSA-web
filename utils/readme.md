# Utils Directory

This directory contains utility functions and helper methods that provide reusable logic throughout the application. These functions do not belong to a specific feature or component but instead offer generic functionalities that can be used across multiple parts of the project.

## ✅ Allowed in /utils:

- Reusable across multiple parts of the application.
- Independent of any specific feature or component.
- Stateless (should not rely on React state, hooks, or external dependencies).
- Focused on general-purpose utilities, such as:
- Formatting helpers (e.g., date, number, string)
- API request wrappers (if they don’t rely on component logic)
- Utility functions for calculations, validations, or object manipulations
